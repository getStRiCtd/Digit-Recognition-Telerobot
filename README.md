# Lecture hall number
I'm working on CV project as part of my student project related to robotics. 
My goal is to make our robot be able to  recognize lecture hall number via its cameras.
<br>
Number plate looks like this _//фотки_

## How it actually works?
So, in our case the most obvious and the simplest way is to take part of image where number plate located and then split it by regions of interest.
